Based on our responses to the T005x student survey, we all feel pretty inexperienced in data visualization. In all professions, more than 80% of respondents reported three years of experience or less. And for only a single profession (information technology) did at least half of respondents report three or more years of experience.

And as a bonus visualization, here's a map of responses by location and profession. Perhaps surprisingly, there's not any terribly obvious clustering of professions by location -- we seem to be pretty occupationally diverse all around the globe!
